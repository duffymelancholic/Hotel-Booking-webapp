# Hotel Booking Web App

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` – React + Vite frontend
- `backend/` – Express.js backend API
- `hotels.json` – Sample hotel data (used as mock DB)

## Getting Started

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
```

The backend will run on port 5000 by default.

## Development Notes
- The backend will serve RESTful APIs for hotels, users, reviews, and authentication.
- The frontend is ready for extension (routing, API calls, etc.).
- Use `hotels.json` as the mock database for backend development.
